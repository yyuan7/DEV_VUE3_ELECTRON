Product Requirement

**Top Priority**
1. incorporate other states

Req: 
Capable to view bottle billing in different states
User Story: 
v1: 
Jim is a manager who wants to review the bottle recycling condition in Maine, New York, and Connecticut. 
v2: 
As a manager, I want to see the bottle recycling database in Maine, New York, and Connecticut, so that I can review the redemption progress in all states CLYNK supported. 



2. minimize typo
2.1 set pattern/template for BR: because HF/D fixed per state, and PPF (pickup processing fee) depend on the distributor. Though it varies once a year, there is not too many options for users to choose. 

Req: 
Provide state/distributor-based templates
User Story: 
Elva is an analyst who would like to see only the 6¢ option when selecting the handling fee in Maine. 
As an analyst, I want to see only the 6¢ option for the handling fee after specifying the state Maine, so that my work can be more accurate and typo can be avoided. 


3. allow users to easily manage business rules without loading everything
4. accommodate to the new architecture (less significant, will be pushed later)
