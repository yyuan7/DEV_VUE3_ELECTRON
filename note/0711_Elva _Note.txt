CONFLUENCE PAGE??
change distri => change br => easy typo
currently pick-up fee is in another system




Operation on BR-Maintain:
- Add new rules
- Deactivate old rules
- Verify??? rules (TBD: is that like to check rules close to end-date?)

Operation on Simple-Rule:
- Search via UPC => return the most recent BR for that product
- Analysis on first/last/total scanned
- Raja: for UPC with no record in simple-Rule, fill the bottom packaging row via online research
Suggestion on Simple-Rule:
- Requirement (elva): for non-redeemable product, will be glad if labels components for why not in state
- Requirement (raja): include the registration year (sometimes they use the same upc even though divide into dif co., )

Operation on CLYNK analyze: 
- Analyze bottle volumes based on selected time periods
- Monitor if new products hit the threshold

Operation Detail: how to add a new BR?
- Requirement: the current procedure is too complicate
- Expectation: when setting a new BR, automatically cut the existing old one
- Current operation: 
1. add on BusinessRulesMaintain
2. admit on Simple-Rule
3. terminate the current BusinessRulesMaintain
4. activate on BusinessRulesMaintain

Operation Detail: how to find a new unrecorded item in the registry?
1. download the excel sheet from https://www.maine.gov/dep/sustainability/bottlebill/index.html
2. run SQL query (or manually) to compare the excel sheet with the CLYNK database
Problem: 
- can have short/expand UPC, which confuse system


Do we need to check BR history based on specific UPC/company/any other factor?

Do you use 3 buttons next to `Add New BR`? useless, even refresh always crash

handling fee option based on state

do have special bar code - unidentified 

if cannot find biller => CLYNK expense account
