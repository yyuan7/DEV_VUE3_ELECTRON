Advice from Gus: 
Kiosk - good to learn Electron
Handscan - recommended by Travis
Clynk Portal - learn the tab design -> clynk-portal/src/Pages/CustomerService/SessionCustomersStore.ts

Dan:
no refresh
pack all db query into one module
restrict # tabs opened at a time
pop-up if unsaved change

unclosable tab
useAppErr.ts
-> composable
update ts
add `vue-router` in dependency rather than d-dependency

v-app -> router-view
only one unique tab in the 
reloading - prevent load (portal)
restore open tabs

send link for tabs??? -> just download excels will be easier

Q to Elva:
1) how do you know which rules to change? does AJ send an excel sheet listing UPCs, or an email from distributor that informs you to yield a product line?
--UPC list from distributors (beverage volume || material)
----UPC search page has `volume`


2) have a list of specific UPCs every time, or change by manufacturer
3) given the billing rule pattern and filter/narrow down by manufacturer, how large will the result be?

Q from Dan:
1) BR search design
2) BR search result display (group by patterns)
3) fix save/load search
``````````````````
err, user-f, archit, security

start with objectives
summary page + ppt

work split
	

Flow: 
1. share Elva's experience
2. show the new BR search / results
3. 
clarify his expectation
focus on the benefit to have a first version release
	separate primary/ secondary/teri
suggest to set a ready time to bring Elva / Jim in, let us know their thoughts






Question: 
1) multiple versions for adding BRs

2) design patterns for ToDo

3) workflow to add BRs
Case 1: UPC with no BRs at all
Case 2: UPC with partial active BRs
case 3: UPC with partial inactive BRs only
case 4: UPC with complete inactive BRs only



Next: finish up all before Tuesday and prepare for Phil

Later Problem: 
1) multiple initiators (where the bag is dropped -> the initiator that gets billed -> different billing rules based on where its dropped)
2) invoice (user role - accountant)

--------------------------------------------------------------------
TODO - only 1 person allowed to flag

manufacturers / distributors / sellers begin the process collecting the deposit fee
=> Beverage retailers charge customer
=> customer charge redemption center
=> rcenter return bottles + charge initiators for deposit&handling


distributor: national bevg.

Elva: bill to distri with invoice add -> distri bill to t.
no billing agent??? -> Elva: billingAG = pickupAG, prefer to remove `pickupAG` if one has to be gone, will double check with Phil next time


BR: only to complete UPCs
BR: include regions

BR: UPC used to have BR but expired, how to add new active BRs then?

BR: batch edit

Prepare BQ:

1. Leadership Principle (reference Amazon LP)
2. Recent BQ lists (be aware the corresponding LP)

- `that's not my job`

L5+:
- the decision you made, why, focus on short-term fix or long-term solution
- how to collaborate with teammates / cross-functional teams
- quantify impacts / results (customer volume, saved time, increased revenue, impact to the current business)
	- people impacted during this project: teammates / other teams / orgs / business verticals
